            Welcome to Rent-a-Sim, where community, entertainment, and
            technology come together to provide the ultimate entertainment
            experience.

            We are Zach and Scott, two friends who met freshman year at Drexel
            University. We've spent many years working in various financial and
            technology roles but with a passion for bringing people together in
            innovative ways. One of the best ways to get to know someone is by
            competing and having fun with each other in a casual and informal
            setting, hence why Rent-a-Sim was born.

            We noticed there is a lack of accessibility for individuals and
            companies to the game, and also to the latest experience with
            technology. We believe in community and greatly enjoy bringing
            people together to create memorable moments.

            Our hope is that Rent a sim will build lasting relationships with
            whomever you decide to share the tee with. We look forward to
            meeting youâ€¦
